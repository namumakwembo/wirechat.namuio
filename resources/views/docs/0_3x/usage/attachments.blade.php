# Attachments

The **Attachments** feature allows users to seamlessly share files and media in conversations, enhancing the communication experience.

---

<x-section-heading label="Enabling Attachments" />

Wirechat allows you to control how attachments are handled on a per-panel basis.
You can enable **all attachments at once**, or selectively enable **file** or **media** attachments only.

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="Enable Attachments" />

Calling `attachments()` enables both file and media attachments.
Setting this to `false` will completely disable attachments for the panel.

```php
use Namu\WireChat\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ..
        ->attachments();
}
````

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="Enable File Attachments Only" />

Use `fileAttachments()` if you want to allow only document uploads such as PDFs, ZIPs, or text files.

```php
use Namu\WireChat\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ..
        ->fileAttachments();
}
```

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="Enable Media Attachments Only" />

Use `mediaAttachments()` to allow users to upload images and videos while disabling file uploads.

```php
use Namu\WireChat\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ..
        ->mediaAttachments();
}
```

---

<x-section-heading label="Sending Attachments" />

Users can share photos, videos, or documents in conversations by following these steps:

1. Open an individual or group chat.
2. Click the **attachment icon**, then choose:

* **Photos & Videos**: Select images or videos from your device.
* **Files**: Select documents (e.g., PDFs, text files).
3. Preview attachments and add or remove files as needed.
4. Click **Send** to share.

---

<x-section-heading label="Storage Configuration" />

Wirechat separates **storage configuration** into two layers to keep things consistent:

* **Global storage settings (config/wirechat.php)**
These are always used by models, jobs, observers, and URL generation.
You must define:

* `attachments.storage_disk` (e.g., `public`, `s3`)
* `attachments.storage_folder` (default `attachments`)
* `attachments.visibility` (`public` or `private`)

```php
// config/wirechat.php
    return [
    'attachments' => [
        'storage_disk'   => 'public',
        'storage_folder' => 'attachments',
        'visibility'     => 'public',
    ],
];
```

* **Panel-level overrides (UI only)**
Panels can optionally customize the **storage folder** to organize uploads differently,
but **disk and visibility must always come from config** for consistency.

---


<x-sub-section-heading label="Max Uploads" />

Control how many files a user can attach per request using **`maxUploads()`**:

```php
$panel->maxUploads(5);
```

This limits the number of attachments allowed in a single message.

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="Media MIME Types" />

Define the allowed media file types that users can upload in conversations.

```php
$panel->mediaMimes(['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'mov', 'mp4']);
```

This ensures only the specified file formats are accepted for media attachments.

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="Media Maximum Upload Size" />

Set the maximum upload size (in KB) for media files.

```php
$panel->mediaMaxUploadSize(12288); // 12 MB
```

Uploads exceeding this size will be rejected by the system.

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="File MIME Types" />

Define the allowed document types that users can attach in conversations.

```php
$panel->fileMimes(['zip', 'rar', 'txt', 'pdf']);
```

Only these file types are permitted for file attachments.

---

<x-sub-section-heading label="File Maximum Upload Size" />

Set the maximum upload size (in KB) for document attachments.

```php
$panel->fileMaxUploadSize(12288); // 12 MB
```

Any file larger than this will be blocked from upload.

---

<x-section-heading label="Validation for Attachments" />

Wirechat validates attachments at two levels:

1. **Client-Side Validation** â€“ Ensures users only upload files that meet the defined rules.
2. **Server-Side Validation** â€“ Uses Laravel and Livewire backend validation for additional security.

> ðŸ’¡ Always keep validation rules in sync with your **panel** settings.
> For security and consistency, disk and visibility are **never panel-controlled** â€” they are always loaded from config.
