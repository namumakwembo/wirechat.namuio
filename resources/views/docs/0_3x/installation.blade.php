# Installation

Wirechat is a simple yet robust chat package built with the [TALL Stack](https://tallstack.dev/), making it easy to integrate into your Laravel app with just a few commands.

---

<x-section-heading label="Prerequisites" />

Before you begin, ensure the following are installed:

* PHP version 8.2 or later
* Laravel version 10 or later
* Livewire version 3.2.3 or later
* Tailwindcss 4.x

---


<x-section-heading label="Installing" />

<x-sub-section-heading label="1. Require composer package" />

Before installing, ensure that authentication is already set up in your application. You may use any starter kit or explore [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) for a simple authentication setup.

```php
composer require wirechat/wirechat:"^0.3.0-beta"
```


<x-sub-section-heading label="2.Install Wirechat:" />


Run this command to install and publish the necessary files:

```bash
php artisan wirechat:install
```

The following actions will be executed:
* Publish configuration file
* Publish migration files
* Create a default panel
* Create a storage symlink

The  `wirechat:install` command will also create a default  panel at `app/Providers/Wirechat/ChatsPanelProvider.php` , so you can go ahead and start [Configuring your panel]({{docs()->route('panels')}}
) and get ready for chatting


<x-sub-section-heading label="3. Run Migrations:"/>

### Enable UUIDs before running migrations (Optional)

If you want Wirechat to use **UUIDs** instead of auto-incrementing integers for conversations, update the config
**before running migrations**:

```php
// config/wirechat.php
'uses_uuid_for_conversations' => true,
```

> ðŸ”¶ **Important:** This setting should only be configured **during initial setup** and **before running any
migrations**. Once the tables are created, switching between UUIDs and integers is not supported and may break
existing data.

**Finally** Apply the necessary database migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```
---

<x-section-heading label="Setup Tailwind CSS"/>

Wirechat `v0.3` requires Tailwind CSS v4.0 or later.

If you already have Tailwind installed in your project, just add the following configuration to your
resources/css/app.css file:

```css
/* resources/css/app.css */
@import '../../vendor/wirechat/wirechat/resources/css/app.css';
```

---


<x-section-heading label="WebSockets and Queue Setup"/>

Wirechat uses WebSockets to broadcast messages in real-time to conversations and their participants.

#### Step 1: Enable Broadcasting

In newer Laravel installations, broadcasting is disabled by default. To enable it, run:

```bash
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

**Note**: This command will prompt you to install Laravel Reverb and necessary front-end packages such as Echo.
Accept if you donâ€™t yet have a WebSocket server set up.

Then, start your Reverb server:

```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

For more details, refer to the [Laravel Broadcasting Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/broadcasting),
including information on integrating Laravel Echo for real-time updates.

#### Step 2: Start Your Queue Worker

After configuring broadcasting, start a [queue worker](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues#driver-prerequisites) to
handle message broadcasting and other queued tasks:

```bash
php artisan queue:listen --queue=messages,default
```


<details class="my-9">

<summary> Queue Prioritization</summary>

Wirechat uses two queues for efficient delivery:


1. **High Priority (`messages`)**: For real-time broadcasting of messages to users in a conversation.
2. **Default Priority (`default`)**: For notifications like updating chat lists or showing unread message
counts.

To customize these queue names Navigate to your panel and set up queues

```php
use Wirechat\Wirechat\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
return $panel
    //...
    ->messagesQueue('messages')
    ->eventsQueue('default');
}
```

</details>

#### Step 3: Step Development Server

To start your development server, run:

```bash
composer run dev
```


If you're not running the latest Laravel version, you can run: `php artisan serve` && `npm run dev` seperately

For more details, see [Laravel's Tailwind and Composer Dev Command
Documentation](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-11-28-0#content-add-tailwind-and-composer-run-dev-command).

<x-section-heading label="Publishing Translations"/>
If you need to customize the language files, you can publish them using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=wirechat-translations
```

<x-section-heading label="Publishing Views"/>
To modify Wirechat's Blade views, publish them with this command:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=wirechat-views
```
